# 🔐 Caesar Cipher App – Cyberpunk Edition

This is my **second completed task** as an intern at **SkillCraft Technology** 🚀

## 🧠 Description

This project is a Caesar Cipher encryption tool built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Instead of a plain UI, I chose to go with a **Cyberpunk-inspired interface** — black background, glowing colors, animated transitions, and slider-based interactions.

It’s simple, interactive, and visually modern.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔢 Caesar Cipher encryption with adjustable shift
- 🎯 Live encryption preview
- 📊 Real-time statistics (letters shifted, preserved, length, etc.)
- ⚡️ Responsive Cyberpunk-style design with Tailwind CSS
- 💡 Built using React + TypeScript
